# This is an example on how to use esm + ts-node

## Usage

1. nvm use
2. npm install
3. npm start

This is the only configuration that worked for me. I tried a bunch of stuff. I
stole this from a github comment on the ts-node github, but can't find it again.

Look at the first commit to see what I started with.
